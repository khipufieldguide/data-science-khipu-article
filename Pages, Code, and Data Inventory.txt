		* 	Search algorithms for each Ascher relationship
		* "Table 1, which ranks the relations by the total number of khipus (out of 650) that exhibit each"
			code to generate this table: https://www.khipufieldmarks.com/analyses/ascher_sums_overview.html#ascher-summation-relationships, but replace "# Significant Khipus" column with # Matching Khipus
			please also add the search criteria (e.g., exact match, loose matching allowed, etc.) for the 9 fieldmarks
		* code to generate figure 1
		* "To this end, a brute-force search of the dataset reveals a wealth of internal pendant-pendant sums arising from the proposed combination of fragments A and B into a single khipu"
			code to generate: https://www.khipufieldmarks.com/analyses/ascher/pendant_pendant_sum/UR231_pendant_pendant_sum.html
		* "At the whole corpus level, we find an approximate 55/45 percentage split in right-handed versus left-handed sums for all four Ascher pendant sum relationships (table 1): 
			pendant-pendant sums (54/46), pendant sums by color (56/44), pendant sums by index (57/43), and subsidiary pendant sums (57/43)"

				https://www.khipufieldmarks.com/analyses/subsidiary_pendant_sum.html#handedness.
		* "This is also not to imply that some 45% of khipus have been recorded backwards, since in most cases (63% across the four named relationships), any given specimen presents both left- and right-handed sums"

		* "contiguous sum cords compose 53% of all pendant-pendant sum cords in the corpus"
				code for https://www.khipufieldmarks.com/analyses/pendant_pendant_sum_location.html#sum-clusters
		* "Here a Monte Carlo simulation is telling: an analysis of “pseudo-khipus” generated from three sample distributions – random uniform, bin-sampling from the corpus, and bin-sampling from the corpus with jittering – confirms the distinctive nature of the reference distribution. This is seen 		most clearly in comparing pendant-pendant sum handedness: while the actual corpus produces a 54% / 46% asymmetry overall (deviating significantly from Normality), the three sample distributions (also with 650 khipus each) consistently yield approximate 50% / 50% splits"

	Top Cords
		* "We instead find such constructions to represent only 28% (107/376) of all top cords, and less than 1% of all khipu sum relationships."

		* "It goes without saying that the 29 total khipus with these properties record small quantities on the other strings: their mean pendant cord values range between 1 (KH0068) and 248 (KH0603)"

		* "For any given sum cluster, 86% of the time, both of its neighboring groups are either additional sum clusters (75%) or knotless cord clusters (11%)"

		* "brute-force search reveals that three-cord “grammatical” color sequences of the type proposed by Clindaniel – light cord minus dark cord equals mixed-color cord – are exceedingly rare, appearing on only six other cords (i.e., two other times) in the 650-khipu corpus"

		* "However, some 116,246 knots and 55,720 strings compel us to instead see a two-way street"
			code needed (I can't find the page).
			* "Simulating the jittered bin-sample khipu corpus 1,000 times, for example, the probability of the observed handedness asymmetry occurring by chance alone is p<0.01 (figure 5)"
			include code for the simulation, as well as the code to generate the CSV file you sent me with the 1,000 runs
			"The sample distributions consistently yield sums with fewer summands, likely capturing spurious combinations of small handfuls of values (figure 6)"
			code to generate the three violin plots
		* "For example, among pendant-subsidiary differences (relation no. 4, table 1), which occur on 145 khipus alongside other relations, only 47/267 total occurrences (18%) involve an absolute value difference of greater than or equal to 10 between contiguous pendants"

	    * "A broader search for long knots with zero loops (implying that they are untied, though this can also reflect data entry errors) returns matches in 17 khipus, all of which have mean pendant cord values in the same, “working” khipu range"
