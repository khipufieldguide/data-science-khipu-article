Construction note: Each of these knots has a short cord tied through it.  The cords are about 2.0 cm long and are color YB:0G (on P1, 2, 4, 65, 67, 85-88, 108, 128, 130) or W (on P5-9, 69, 72, 73, 91, 93, 114, 133, 135).  They are attached at the bottom of the knots.  Figure 1 shows an example of an attachement to a 3L knot. (See Ascher notes page 340.)<br/>2. Construction note: The main cord begins with a fringed woven ball. (See Ascher notes page 341.)<br/>3. Construction note: (a) Markers are thick, short cords that are looped around the main cord, twisted about 4 times, and bound.  (b) In some cases (M3, M6, M11, M19, M20), the main cord has first been wrapped with YB:BB cord for a length of about 1.0 cm. (See Ascher notes page 341.)<br/>4. Construction note: Markers M32 and M39 each have a cord attached though them.  The cord are listed as T1 and T2 respectively because, as with the top cords, they are attached to the loops of the markers in the same way that a top cord is usually attached to the main cord. (See Ascher notes page 342.)<br/>5. Construction note: In addition to the markers, there are other exceptional cords attached to the main cord.  They are called ""flags.""  All are blank, YB, and much longer or shorter than surrounding cords.  (Because of the slight space between F2 and F4, and the discoloration of the main cord, it is assumed that an F3 was in that space.)<br/>6. By spacing, the quipu is seperated into 24 groups.  Each group has the same basic pattern: BB, (YB, W, YB, YB), BB, (YB, W, YB, YB), (YB, W, YB, YB), BB, Marker, (YB, W, YB, YB), (FB:W with a subsidiary of YB/0G, YB, 0G).  In groups that have less than 22 pendants, it is 1 or 2 of the BB cords that are non-existant.  Parentheses have been used to emphasize that each group is made up of 5 subgroups, with the first 4 having the same color pattern.  As well as there being a marker between the 3rd and 4th subgroup in each group, there are as many as 3 markers or 4 flags between some consecutive groups.<br/>7. The flag F1, just after the 7th group, separates the quipu into 2 parts.  (i) The first part, consisting of 7 groups, has pendant values from 0-104.  With 1 exception, all knots on pendants in subgroups 1 and 2 are tagged (see #1 above).  The tags in subgroup 1 are YB:0G, and those in subgroup 2 are W.<br/>(ii) By contrast, in part 2, consisting of 17 groups, there are no tagged knots.  The values also differ.  With the exception of the value on 1 subsidiary, all values are 0, 1, 2, or 4.  Moreover, most of the values in subgroups 1-3 are 0, most in subgroup 4 are 1, and the values 2 and 4 appear only in subgroup 5.",

However, when viewed as groups of 15 pendants with some positions non-existant in each group, the colors and values are repetitions.  The 25 groups of 15 pendants have been arranged in a rectangular table (see Table 1).  A blank means the position is non-existant, an M is a missing pendant, and a ? indicates that the pendant is broken, so the value is unknown.  A double line has been used to mark a change in color.  Where there is no color change, but just a color anomaly, the value has been circled.  Observe from the table that although similarities remain, there are decided differences between part 1 (groups 1-15) and part 2 (groups 16-26).  Also, within part 1, there are several changes after the 15th group and after the 12th group.",

This is one of several quipus acquired by the Museum in 1907 with provenance Pachacamac. For a list of them, see AS97.<br/>2. By spacing, the quipu is separated into 45 groups of 5 pendants each. There is a larger space after every 3rd group and a still larger space between the 21st and 22nd groups and the 24th and 25th groups.  Thus, the quipu is in 3 parts: part 1 is 7 sets of 3 groups each; part 2 is 1 set of 3 groups; and part 3 is 7 sets of 3 groups.<br/>3. All groups in part 1 have the same color pattern: W(with a W subsidiary); LB (with an LB subsidiary); YG; YB; YB:0G.  Groups in parts 2 and 3 have the same pattern for the first 3 pendant positions and then vary in one or both of the last 2 positions.  Calling the colors in the part 1 pattern C1-C5, the color patterns are summarized in Table 1. (See table in notes)<br/>4. In parts 1 and 3, many values are repeated in the same position in consecutive groups or in the same position 2 groups later. The former can be represented as Psub ij = Psub(i+1,j) and the latter as Psub ij = P sub(i+2,j). In part 1, these hold in 20 and 12 places respectively; in part 2 in no places; and in part 3 in 27 and 18 places.<br/>5. The values in part 2 are related to the sums of values in part 3. Position by position, values in group 1 of part 2 are related to the sums of values in the first groups in each of the 7 sets in part 3; group 2 values are related to sums of values in the second groups of each of the sets; and group 3 values to the sums of values of the third group.

AS074-AS080 are associated.  See AS074 for discussion.<br/>3.   By spacing, color pattern, and markers 1, 2, 3, the quipu is separated into 5 parts: Part I consists of 1 group of 7 pendants and Parts II, III, IV, V each consist of 8 groups of 5 or 6 pendants each.<br/>4.   The 32 groups of Parts II-V have the same color pattern: BS (if present), YB, YB, YB, MB, B.  The first position (BS) never exists in Part V and sometimes exists in the other parts.<br/>5.   Some numerical consistencies appear on the quipu.  (a) All values are 0-3 in Part II, 0-4 in Part III, and 0-5 in Part V.  (b) In Part II, positions 5 and 6 are all zero-valued.  In Part V, position 2 is always zero-valued.  (c) In the second, third, fourth, and eighth groups of Part III, pendants 2, 3, 4 are consecutive values.  (d) The following relationships hold for all 8 groups of Part IV: P4 is greater than P3 is greater than or equal to P6 is greater than or equal to P5, and P4 > P2.<br/>6.   The pendants in Part I contain as many as two or three values.  For example, 3s knots followed by 2L knots followed by 5s knots followed by 2L knots is interpreted as 32 then 52.  This type of multiple value is only found on this part of the quipu.  The 7 pendants in Part I also do not have the same color pattern as the other 32 groups.  This part of the quipu seems to be some kind of summary group.  Values in it can be associated with values in the other parts in several ways, none of which accounts for all the values.  For example, 15 & 12 appears on an MB colored pendant--the sum of the MB colored pendants in Parts II & III is 15 and the sum of the MB colored pendants in Parts IV & V is 12.  Also, if the eight groups in Part III are summed position by position, the sums are ?, 9, 12, 18, 15, 11.  Each of these values is found in Part I.<br/>7.   Part V is further divided into groups of 3, 3, 2 by markers 4 and 5.  These markers do not seem to be very carefully constructed--one is a prepared blank pendant--or carefully attached.  Since no space separates the third from fourth group and the sixth from seventh group, the markers may have been used for group separators.",

This quipu is associated with AS59-AS67. See discussion under AS59.<br/>2. From the discoloration of the main cord, and by extrapolation based on the spacing of the complete groups, we hypothesize that this quipu contained 24 groups of 8 pendants. Each of the groups had a top cord. Of the original 80 pendants of the first 10 groups, only 35 remain and so the first complete group starts with pendant 36. Of the last 14 groups, no pendants are missing.<br/>3. Two loose broken cords were associated with this quipu: one, colored DB, had a value of 50; the other, colored AB, had a value of 14.<br/>4. Both common forms of the top cord attachment are present on this quipu. In groups 18, 19 , and 21-24, the top cord unites the pendants. In the remaining groups, the top cord is attached to the main cord in the center of the group. The first pendant of the 18th group (P92) is a different color than the rest of the group reinforcing the idea that this is a place where a change occurs.<br/>5. All pendant cords within a group are the same color with the exception of group 18 noted above and groups 16, 20 and 23 in which the first 4 pendants are one color and the last 4 another color. In 2 of these groups the top cord is the same color as the first 4 pendants in the group. The third group has the top cord missing so its color is unknown.<br/>6. Only 6 groupd have the top cord the same color as all the pendants in the group. Five of these groups are the only groups for which all pendants in the group have the same value.<br/>7. The color of the top cords for groups 8-11 (BB, W, DB, W) are repeated for the next 4 groups.<br/>8. With the exception of group 19, all groups that have all pendat values and top cord value present show the following relationship: (represented in notes by formulae)<br/>9. As noted in observation 6, five groups have all pendat values equal. The sum value on the top cord must, therefore, be a multiple of 8. In some cases where the top value is not a multiple of 8, the pendant values can be viewed as top value/8 rounded to the nearest integers. This is seen in groups 11, 12, 16, 23 where the sums are 50. The pendant values 6x6 + 2x7. Similarly in group 9, the pendant values can be viewed as rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. That is 150 = 3x40 + 1x30.<br/>10. Groups 17 and 19 both have the same relationship among the first 4 pendants: {P1=P2=X/4+3; P3=X/4+4; P4=X/4-10 } and as result { P1+P2=X/2+6; P3+P4=X/2 -6}. For group 17, X=100 and for group 19, X=112. Since group 19 is the only group for which P1+P2+P3+P4 does not = P5+P6+P7+P8, it is interesting to note that also P1+P2+P3+P4 = [top value/2]-6<br/>10. Groups 17 and 19 both have the same relationship among the first 4 pendants: (formulae)",

Quipus AS026A and AS026B were joined.  Their linkage and a comparison of their colors are detailed with AS026A.<br/>2. Most of the subsidiaries (103 of 150) have one knot.  While some are single knots and some are figure eight knots, their positions on the cords are the same.  Both types have been interpreted as value 1.<br/>3. By spacing, there are 11 groups and 2 single pendants.  The color of the pendants in the first 2 groups is W; in the next 3 groups all are MB; and for groups 6-11, the colors alternate.  Group 6 is MB, group 7 is W, groups 8 is MB, etc.  Both single pendants are W.<br/>4. The groups that have 9 or 10 pendants (with the exception of group 11) have values that are similarly internally related.  The relationship is of particular interest because it involves halving.  These groups, discussed below in greater detail, are groups 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.<br/>(i) Each group can be described in terms of one value.  Calling this value N, basically the pendants in the group contain:<br/>(a) Where N = 8 (in groups 4, 6, 8), the value 8 is represented by a long knot of 4 immediately followed by a long knot of 4, rather than by a long knot of 8.  Half of it is one long knot of 4 (in groups 4 and 8).  By contrast, there is a double long knot of 2 in group 6.  It is the distributive axiom, of course, that justifies the use of these 2 procedures to arrive at equivalent results.  Namely, A = (A+A)/2 = (A/2) + (A/2).<br/>(b) Since halving when only integers are used causes problems for odd values, it is important to note that 9/2 = 4.<br/>(ii) Including subsidiary values, the values of the positions change but the basic internal pattern remains the same.  Since there are 0-3 subsidiaries per pendant position, there are more inconsistancies.  The values and their representations are detailed:<br/>(a) Comparison of the arithmetic in groups 1 and 2 again shows the two different orders of computation: 28/2=14 uses (A+B+B)/2 = (A/2) + (B/2) + (B/2), while 11/2=5 uses (A+B+B)/2 = (A/2) + (2B/2) = (A/2) + B.<br/>(b) The odd numbers present are 11, 9, 5.  note that 11/2=5 in all positions and 5/2=2 in 3 of 6 positions.  However, 5/2=3 in one position and is unclear (2+?) in 2 positions.  Also, 9/2 now equals 5 in 5 of 6 positions.  It might be that the representation of 9 by 4+4+1 is leading to this alternate result.  Overall, in halving 18 odd numbers, 10 of them are rounded down, 6 are rounded up, and 2 involve broken cords.<br/>(iii) The focus on halving is also seen by comparing the basic values of consecutive groups.  The values of N )without subsidiaries) for groups 6-10 are 8, 4, 8, 4, 2.  Within each group, the number of consecutive pendants with repeated values also shows a halving pattern: two have value N followed by 1 of value N/2; then 4 or 5 have value N followed by 2 of value N/2.",

The Museum designates the quipu as donated by Gaffron.  Huacho u. Pachacamac is the provenance.<br/>2.  AS088 is also discussed by Nordeskiold (see Introduction, Table 3).<br/>3.  By spacing, the quipu is separated into 25 groups.  Groups 2-13 and groups 14-23 are united by values and color pattern.  Group 24 is separated from group 23 by a much larger space on the main cord.  Hence, the quipu can be described as in 4 parts: Part I contains 1 group of 2 pendants; Part II is groups 2-13; Part III is groups 14-23; and Part IV is groups 24-25.<br/>4.  Part II consists of 12 groups of 4 pendants each.  (The first group has an additional blank pendant.)  For every group, the color pattern is YB: W, MB, W, MB.  Subsidiaries appear only on the 2nd and 3rd pendant positions: those in the second position are YB and those in the third are W.  The values on the first, second, and fourth pendants of the first group are the sums of the pendant values in the corresponding positions in the remaining 11 groups.

It is unlikely that the fragment is part of broken P50, P10s1, or P18s1 because the knots would not be aligned with the others in the group.  The fragment's value (33) would make it unlikely to be part of broken P48 or the pendant that may be missing just after P35 (see comment 2).  These would be expected to have values less than 10.

The quipu, received by the museum in 1925, was part of the collection of Charles F Gunther.  Its provenance was stated as Peru.  The quipu was received by the museum in a basket made of woven reeds (13.0 cm x 6.0 cm x 34.0 cm).  The basket also contained 41 spindles, 55 sticks and needles, 4 whorls, 1 bundle of sticks, 2 skeins of yarn, 7 miscellaneous samples of rope, reed, and textiles, and 1 bag of unspun cotton fiber.  The color of the cotton fiber was similar to the browns of the quipu cords.  There is no statement as to whether or not the quipu was found in the basket and none of the yarn or fiber colors are sufficiently distinctive to associate them with the quipu.<br/>3. By spacing the quipu is separated into 5 groups.  By color and values the groups form 3 parts: part I is a group of 4 pendants; part II is two groups of 6 and 8 pendants respectively; and part III is two groups of 6 pendants each.<br/>4.

These values are significant in that all values greater than 18 that appear on the quipu are multiples of 18 or of 7.  The multiples of each that appear are 18,36,54,72 and 7,14,21,28,35,70.<br/>6. In addition to the fact that the values in positions 4 and 7 of groups 4,5,6 are multiples of 7 or 18, they are also consistantly multiples of values in other positions.

This collection is also discussed in Knot Records in Ancient and Modern Peru, C. J. Mackey, University of California, Berkeley, Ph.D. theses, 1970, Chapter 4, pp. 83-99.  Details of portions of AS061 and AS067 are further described by the author on pp. 259-262.<br/>4.

Top cords appear on AS066 and AS067.  In AS066, both common forms of top cords are used-those uniting pendant cords and those attached to the main cord.  In AS067, the only form used is attachment to the main cord.  Both quipus have thes top cords centered within groups of 8 pendants.<br/>6. AS063, AS064, AS066, and AS067 all have twisted end of the main cord knotted.<br/>7. Several of the quipus in this collection have restricted values.
